# LineFollowerBot
 Line Follower Robot using Arduino Uno Based on PID Algorithm
## Parts Required :
- Chasis
- Arduino Uno Microcontroller
- Motors + Wheels 
- L298N motor driver board
- 5 TCRT5000 infrared Sensors
- LEDs + resistors
- One Breadboard for LED connections
- Batteries
- Cables, screws and bolts 
### Note : 
- The integral part and the derivative part of the PID controller were not required for this project.
- As this robot has no drift so therefore , Integral part was not required.
- The derivative part was not required because the robot shows no oscillations in its movements. 
- Proportional adjustments are small enough to avoid oscillations and frequent enough to keep the robot on track.
